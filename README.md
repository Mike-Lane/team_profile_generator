I have been tasked with creating a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

  <li>When the user is prompted for their team members and their information an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input</li>
  <li>When the user clicks on an email address in the HTML their default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address</li>
  <li>When the user clicks on the GitHub username that GitHub profile opens in a new tab</li>
  <li>When the user starts the application they are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<.li>
  <li>When they enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number they are presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team</li>
  <li>When the user selects the engineer option they are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, then they are taken back to the menu</li>
  <li>When they select the intern option they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and then they are taken back to the menu</li>
  When the user decides to finish building their team, then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated</li>
</ul>
